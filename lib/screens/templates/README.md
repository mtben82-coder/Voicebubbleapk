## 🧠 EXPERT DOMAIN KNOWLEDGE

Each interview includes:

**What Pros Know**
- ATS systems reject 75% of resumes before humans see them
- Admissions officers read 50 essays/day - they spot AI instantly
- VCs decide in 2 minutes if they're interested

**Secret Formulas**
- Resume: [Action Verb] + [Task] + [Result with Number]
- College Essay: Moment → Context → Struggle → Insight → Growth
- Pitch: Problem → Solution → Traction → Market → Team → Ask

**Common Mistakes**
- Resume: "Responsible for..." (passive, boring)
- Essay: Starting with a quote (red flag for cliché)
- Pitch: "If we get just 1% of the market" (credibility killer)

**Industry Secrets**
- Resume: Use exact keywords from job posting (ATS matches them)
- Essay: Essays about failure often outperform achievement essays
- Pitch: Warm intros convert 10x higher than cold outreach
