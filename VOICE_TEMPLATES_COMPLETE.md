## 🧠 AI MAGIC

Each template has custom AI prompts that:

1. **Extract** → Pull specific information (dates, names, tasks, etc.)
2. **Categorize** → Organize into correct sections (Dairy vs Meat, Work vs Personal)
3. **Format** → Apply proper structure (checkboxes, bullets, numbered lists, tables)
4. **Clean** → Fix grammar while preserving meaning
5. **Enhance** → Add detail where appropriate

Example AI Prompt (Grocery List):
```
"You are organizing a grocery list by category.
Listen for food items and categorize them:
- Dairy: milk, eggs, cheese, yogurt, butter
- Meat & Seafood: chicken, beef, fish, pork
- Fruits & Veggies: all produce
- Frozen: frozen foods
- Drinks: beverages
- Others: anything that doesn't fit above
Format each as checkboxes. Add quantities if mentioned."
```
